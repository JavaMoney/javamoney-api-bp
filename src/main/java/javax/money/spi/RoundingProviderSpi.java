/**
 * This SPI allows to extends/override the roundings available for
 * {@link javax.money.CurrencyUnit}. The JSRs implementation already provides default
 * roundings. By registering instances of this interface using the
 * {@link Bootstrap}, the default behaviour can be
 * overridden and extended, e.g. for supporting also special roundings.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be
 * <ul>
 * <li>thread-safe
 * <li>not require loading of other resources.
 * </ul>
 * If required, it is possible to implement this interface in a contextual way,
 * e.g. providing different roundings depending on the current EE application
 * context. Though in most cases rounding should be a general concept that does
 * not require contextual handling.
